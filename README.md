# Human typing

## Description

This script takes text from the clipboard and types it out in a human-like manner.

## Usage

There's some text in your clipboard, you press `ctrl+enter`. This puts the text from the clipboard into the program's variable. After that, you start the typing process with the `pause` key. With the same key, you can stop and resume it at any moment.

## Features

Implemented are the simulation of typing errors and a changeable typing speed. You can pause it with the `pause` key. If you accidentally (or intentionally) move the mouse, the typing will stop.
